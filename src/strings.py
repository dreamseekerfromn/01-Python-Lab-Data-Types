# Task 1: String Manipulation
# ---------------------------
# 1. Concatenate the following strings: "Python", " is", " awesome!"
# 2. Repeat the string "Code" 7 times and print the result.
# 3. Extract the substring "top" from the string "Octopocalypse".
# 4. Reverse the string "Python".

# Print the results of each operation.

# Task 2: Advanced String Operations
# ----------------------------------
# Write a Python function that:
# 1. Counts the number of vowels in a given string.
# 2. Replaces all occurrences of a given character in a string with another character.

def count_vowels(s):
    # Your code here
    pass

def replace_char(s, old, new):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Task 3: String Formatting
# -------------------------
# Write a Python function that accepts a user's first name and last name, then returns a string formatted as "Last, First".
# If the name is not provided (either first or last), it should default to "Unknown".

def format_name(first_name="Unknown", last_name="Unknown"):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Task 4: String Validation
# -------------------------
# Write a Python function that checks if a given string is a valid email address. For simplicity, assume an email is valid if it contains exactly one "@" symbol and at least one "." after the "@".

def is_valid_email(email):
    # Your code here
    pass
